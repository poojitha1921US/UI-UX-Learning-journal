              **UI vs UX Design**

>>> User Interface (UI) Design is focused on the visual and interactive elements of a product. This includes typography, colors, buttons, icons, spacing, and      layout. The goal of UI design is to create an interface that is aesthetically pleasing, consistent across devices, and easy to navigate.

>>> User Experience (UX) Design covers the entire process of a user's interaction with a productâ€”from research and planning to testing and iteration. It ensures the product is functional, accessible, and meets user needs effectively. UX design includes:

1). User research (interviews, personas, journey mapping)

2). Information architecture and user flows

3). Wireframing and prototyping

4). Usability testing and performance analysis


   **Key Differences**

>>UI is about how the product looks

>>UX is about how the product works and feels

>>UI is a subset of UX

>>UI = visual design; UX = overall user journey and problem-solving
